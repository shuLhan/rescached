== NAME

rescached - DNS resolver cache daemon.


== SYNOPSIS

+rescached+ 'rescached.cfg'


== OPTIONS

'rescached.cfg' is rescached configuration, usually it reside in
/etc/rescached/rescached.cfg.


== DESCRIPTION

+rescached+ is a daemon that caching internet name and address on local memory
for speeding up DNS resolution.

+rescached+ is not a reimplementation of DNS server like BIND.

+rescached+ primary goal is only to caching DNS queries and answers, used by
personal or small group of users, to minimize unneeded traffic to outside
network.


=== Features

List of current features,

- Enable to handle request from UDP and TCP connections.
- Load and serve addresses and hostnames in +/etc/hosts+.
- Load and serve hosts formated files inside directory
  +/etc/rescached/hosts.d/+.
- Blocking ads and/or malicious websites through list in
  +/etc/rescached/hosts.d/hosts.block+.
- Load and serve master file format in +/etc/rescached/master.d+.

=== Behind The DNS

When you open a website, let say 'kilabit.info', in a browser, the first thing
that browser do is to translate name address 'kilabit.info' into an internet
address (e.g.: 103.200.4.162) so browser can make a connection to
'kilabit.info' server.

How browser do that?

First, it will send query to one of DNS server listed in your system
configuration (i.e. +/etc/resolv.conf+ in Linux).
Then, if your DNS server also "caching" the name that you requested, it will
reply the answer (internet address) directly, if it is not then it will ask
their parent DNS server.

----
+----+      +----------------+      +------------------+
| PC | <==> | ISP DNS Server | <==> | Other DNS Server | <==> ...
+----+      +----------------+      +------------------+
----

If you browsing frequently on the same site, hitting the refresh button,
opening another page on the same website, etc; this procedures will always
repeated every times, not including all external links like ads, social media
button, or javascripts from an other server.

To make this repetitive procedures less occurred, you can run +rescached+ in
your personal computer.
The first time the answer is received in your local computer, +rescached+ will
saved it in computer memory and any subsequent request of the same address
will be answered directly by +rescached+.

+----+      +----------------+      +------------------+
| PC |      | ISP DNS Server | <==> | Other DNS Server | <==> ...

The only request that will be send to your DNS server is the one that does not
already exist in +rescached+ cache.


=== How Cache in +rescached+ Works

This section explain the simplified version of how internal program works.

Each DNS record in cache have the time last accessed field, which defined how
the cache will be ordered in memory.
The last queried host-name will be at the bottom of cache list, and the oldest
queried host-name will at the top of cache list.

The following table illustrate list of caches in memory,

----
+---------------------+------------------+
| Accessed At         | host-name        |
+---------------------+------------------+
| 2018-01-01 00:00:01 | kilabit.info     |
+---------------------+------------------+
| 2018-01-01 00:00:02 | www.google.com   |
+---------------------+------------------+
|         ...         |        ...       |
+---------------------+------------------+
| 2018-01-01 00:01:00 | www.kilabit.info |
+---------------------+------------------+
----

Every +cache.prune_delay+ (e.g. 5 minutes), rescached will try to pruning old
records from cache.
If the accessed-at value of record in cache is less than,

----
	current-time + cache.threshold
----

(remember than +cache.threshold+ value must be negative) it will remove the
record from cache.


== Installation

=== Prerequisites

* https://golang.org[Go compiler]
* https://git-scm.com[git, version control system]
* asciidoc, to generate manual page
* systemd or system V init tool for service

=== Compiling From Source

Steps to compile from source,

----
	$ go get -u github.com/shuLhan/rescached-go
	$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/shuLhan/rescached-go.git
	$ go build ./cmd/rescached
----

The last command will build binary named +rescached+ in current directory.

=== Installation

After program successfully build, you can install it manually by copying to
system binary directory.

==== Manual Installation

* Copy rescached configuration to system directory.
We use directory "/etc/rescached" as configuration directory.
+
	$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/rescached
	$ sudo cp cmd/rescached/rescached.cfg /etc/rescached

* Copy rescached program to your system path.
+
	$ sudo cp cmd/rescached/rescached /usr/bin

* Create system startup script.
+
If you want your program running each time the system is starting up you can
create a system startup script (or system service).
You can see an example for +init.d+ startup script in file
+scripts/rescached.run+ and for +systemd+ service in
+scripts/rescached.service+.
+
This step is really different between each system, consult your distribution
wiki, forum, or mailing-list on how to create system startup script.

==== Post Installation Configuration

* Set your parent DNS server.
+
Edit rescached configuration, +/etc/rescached/rescached.cfg+, change the value
of +server.parent+ based on your preferred DNS server.

* Set the cache prune delay and threshold
+
Edit rescached configuration, +/etc/rescached/rescached.cfg+, change the value
of +cache.prune_delay+ and/or +cache.threshold+ to match your needs.

* Set your system DNS server to point to rescached.
+
In UNIX system,
+
	$ sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.org
	$ sudo echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf

* If you use +systemd+, run +rescached+ service by invoking,
+
	$ sudo systemctl start rescached.service
+
and if you want +rescached+ service to run when system startup, enable it by
invoking,
+
	$ sudo systemctl enable rescached.service

License file for this software.

'/var/run/rescached.pid'::

File where process ID of rescached will be saved when running.


== NOTES

This program developed with references to,

'RFC1034':: Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities.
'RFC1035':: Domain Names - Implementation and Specification.
'RFC1886':: DNS Extensions to support IP version 6.
'RFC2782':: A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)

== BUGS

+rescached+ only know specific DNS record type,
[horizontal]
A:: A host address in IPv4
NS:: An authoritative name server
CNAME:: A canonical name for an alias
SOA::  Start of [a zone of] authority record
MB:: Mail box
MG:: Mail group
NULL:: Placeholders for experimental extensions
WKS:: Record to describe well-known services supported by a host
PTR:: Pointer to a canonical name.
HINFO:: Host information
MINFO:: Mail information
MX:: Mail exchange
TXT:: Text record
AAAA:: A host address in IPv6
SRV:: Service locator
OPT:: This is a "pseudo DNS record type" needed to support EDNS

+rescached+ only run and tested in Linux system.
Technically, if it can compiled, it will run in any operating system.
