=  Rescached v4.1.0 (2021-12-03)

==  Breaking changes

*  all: remove using tcp scheme in config and documentation

   Using TCP for parent name server is discouraged, because most of server
   disallow keeping the connection alive.

   The valid use case for TCP connection is when server received truncated
   UDP answer.

   Using UDP as parent scheme, will automatically assume that the server
   also capable of handling query in TCP.
   This is required when client (for example, your browser) re-send the query
   after receiving truncated UDP answer.
   Any query received by rescached through TCP will forwarded to the parent
   name server as TCP too, using the same address and port defined in one of
   UDP parent.

   While at it, use Cloudflare DNS server as default in configuration
   and as example in documentation.

==  New features

*  Add support to save and load caches to/from storage upon restart

   rescached now able to save and load caches to local storage upon restart.

   On POSIX, the caches is stored in /var/cache/rescached/rescached.gob,
   encoded using gob.

   Update #9

==  Bug fixes

*  make the TCP forwarders as complementary of UDP

   The TCP forwarders only active when client send the DNS request as TCP.
   When the server receive that request it should also forward the request
   as TCP not as UDP to prevent the truncated response.

   Another use case for TCP is when the response is truncated, the client
   will send the query back through TCP connection.  The server should
   forward this request using TCP instead of UDP.

==  Enhancements

*  remove the fallback name servers (NS) from server options

   The original idea of fallback NS is to send the query to the one
   define in resolv.conf, instead of using the one defined by user in
   ServerOptions NameServers, when an error occured.

   But, most of error usually caused by network (disconnected, time out),
   so re-sending query to fallback NS does not have any effect if the
   network it self is not working.

   This changes remove the unnecessary and complex fallback NS from
   server.

*  Do not cache truncated answer

   Previously only answer with non-zero response code is ignored.

   This changes ignore also answer where response header is truncated.


=  Rescached v4.0.0 (2021-01-25)

==  New features

Rescached now have a web user interface (wui) that can be accessed at
http://127.0.0.1:5380.

The interface can be used to monitoring caches, managing caches, environment,
blocked hosts, internal hosts files, and zone files.

==  Breaking changes

*  The `rescached::dir.hosts` now default to "/etc/rescached/hosts.d"

*  The `rescached::dir.master` now default to "/etc/rescached/zone.d"


=  Rescached v3.0.2 (2020-05-08)

*  go.mod: comment replace directive
   This cause package is un-buildable using normal go get or git clone.

   Sorry :/


=  Rescached v3.0.1 (2020-05-07)

==  Enhancements

*  dns: change the mark of input/output in log output
   Previously, the character '<' is used to indicate incoming request
   from client and '>' to indicate outgoing response.
   This change reverse it because '<' make more sense for output and '>'
   is for input (looks like cin and cout on C++ world)

==  Bug fixes

*  dns: fix index out of range when unpacking OPT RR
*  dns: forward the request to fallback queue if there is no forwarders

==  Chores

*  Add prefix "_" to all non-Go source directories.
   This is to ignore the directory being scanned by Go tools.


=  Rescached v3.0.0 (2020-01-15)

==  Enhancements

* Makefile: remove unused option "CGO_ENABLED=0"

==  Bug Fixes

* Makefile: remove invalid task "install-service-systemd"

* cmd: fix formatting arguments


=  Rescached v3.0.0-alpha (2019-12-26)

All the server core functionalities (caches and forwarding) now
implemented inside "dns.Server".  The main function of this package are
for reading options from configuration file (or from command line options)
and watching changes from system resolv.conf.

==  New Features

*  Support serving and forwarding DNS over TLS

*  Add launchd script for macOS and make tasks to install and uninstall on
   macOS

==  Breaking Changes

There are also some major changes on configuration file.
All configuration now break into two section '[rescached]' and
'[dns "server"]'.
For more information see new rescached.cfg manual page or an example in
`cmd/rescached/rescached.cfg`.

Some detailed changes are,

*  "parent" option now use URI format instead of IP:PORT.
   This will allow parent name servers to be UDP, TCP, and/or DoH
   simultaneously.

*  "server.doh.parent" and "server.parent.connection" are removed,
   redundant with new "server.parent" format.

*  "cache.threshold" is renamed to "cache.prune_threshold".

*  "file.pid" is removed.
+
The concept of writing PID file when the program start on networking
service is not applicable or relevant anymore on systemd or launchd.
If the program already started, the second program will fail because
the port is already used.


=  Rescached v2.1.2 (2019-03-22)

==  Bug Fix

Use single Go routine to handle request.  This fix mismatched ID in
response due to single response is being use by multiple routines.


=  Rescached v2.1.1 (2019-03-02)

==  Enhancements

*  Run multiple (4) go routines to handle request
*  Make the debug output to be more human readable

==  Bug Fixes

*  cmd/resolver: fix query with zero ID


=  Rescached v2.1.0 (2019-02-01)

==  New Features

-  Change default parent nameservers to Cloudflare DNS.
We believe in Cloudflare!
Please read Cloudflare DNS policy for more information,

	https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/

==  Enhancements

-  Improve response performance.  Previously we can serve around 93k request
per second (RPS).  The new enhancement increase the RPS to around 115k.

==  Bug Fixes

-  Fix the example certificate and key for DNS over HTTPS
-  Fix the hosts.block destination file in script to update blocked host file
-  Fix response with different query type that may not get pruned
